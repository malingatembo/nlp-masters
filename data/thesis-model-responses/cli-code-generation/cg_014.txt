   a. EOS CLI command:
   ```
   eos restart
   ```
   b. EOS CLI output:
   ```
   Restarting EOS...
   EOS_RESTART_COMPLETED
   ```

3. Restore factory default startup configuration
   a. EOS CLI command:
   ```
   eos restore-config default-config
   ```
   b. EOS CLI output:
   ```
   Restoring default configuration...
   EOS_RESTORE_CONFIG_COMPLETED

To restore the factory default EOS image and startup configuration on an Arista switch, you can follow these commands:

1. First, access the switch via the CLI (Command Line Interface). You can do this by connecting a console cable to the switch and using a terminal emulator such as PuTTY.

2. Once you're in the CLI, enter the privileged EXEC mode using the following command:

```bash
enable
```

3. Now, you can erase the current startup configuration with the following command:

```bash
write erase
```

4. Confirm the operation by pressing `Enter` when prompted.

5. After erasing the startup configuration, reload the switch to apply the changes:

```bash
reload
```

6. Confirm the operation by pressing `Enter` when prompted.

7. After the switch reboots, it will be in its factory default state. You will need to go through the initial setup process again.

Please note that these commands will erase all the configuration on the switch and reboot it. Make sure to backup any important configuration before proceeding.
