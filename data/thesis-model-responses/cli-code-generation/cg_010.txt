EOS CLI commands:

1. Login to the Arista switch.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   eos client
   ```

3. Use the following command to list all the switches on the network:

   ```
   eos switch
   ```

4. Use the following command to list all the interfaces on the switch:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

5. Use the following command to list all the configuration files on the switch:

   ```
   eos configuration file
   ```

6. Use the following command to remove the enable password from the startup configuration of the interface:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

7. Use the following command to set the enable password for the interface:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

8. Use the following command to modify the configuration file:

   ```
   eos configuration file
   ```

9. Use the following command to apply the configuration file:

   ```
   eos configuration apply
   ```

10. Use the following command to validate the configuration:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

11. Use the following command to check the configuration:

   ```
   eos configuration show
   ```

12. Use the following command to generate the configuration code for removing the enable password from the startup configuration of the interface:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

13. Use the following command to generate the configuration code for setting the enable password for the interface:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

14. Use the following command to generate the configuration code for modifying the configuration file:

   ```
   eos configuration file
   ```

15. Use the following command to generate the configuration code for applying the configuration file:

   ```
   eos configuration apply
   ```

16. Use the following command to validate the configuration:

   ```
   eos interface
   ```

17. Use the following command

1. First, you need to reboot the Arista switch. You can do this by physically power cycling the switch or by using the following command if you have access to the CLI:

    ```
    reload
    ```

2. As the switch is booting up, you need to interrupt the boot process to enter the ROMMON mode. You can do this by sending a break signal during the boot process.

3. Once you are in the ROMMON mode, you need to change the configuration register to ignore the startup configuration. You can do this with the following command:

    ```
    confreg 0x2142
    ```

4. Now, you need to reboot the switch again. You can do this with the following command:

    ```
    boot
    ```

5. After the switch reboots, it will ignore the startup configuration and you will be able to enter the privileged EXEC mode without a password. 

6. Now, you need to load the startup configuration into the running configuration. You can do this with the following command:

    ```
    copy startup-config running-config
    ```

7. Now, you can remove the enable password from the configuration. You can do this with the following commands:

    ```
    configure terminal
    no enable secret
    ```

8. Finally, you need to save the running configuration to the startup configuration and change the configuration register back to its original value. You can do this with the following commands:

    ```
    copy running-config startup-config
    config-register 0x2102
    ```

9. Now, you can reboot the switch one more time to apply the changes. You can do this with the following command:

    ```
    reload
    ```

After the switch reboots, the enable password will be removed from the startup configuration.
