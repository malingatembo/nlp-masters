QUESTION: Write the EOS CLI commands to configure agile ports on an Arista 7150 series switch, combining SFP+ interfaces to form a 40G port.

[[CODE:code_subsubsection_9_5_11_0]]

<!-- CODE:START -->
switch#config
switch(config)#interface ethernet 13
switch(config-if-Et13)#speed forced 40gfull

  WARNING!  Executing this command will cause the forwarding agent
            to be restarted. All interfaces will briefly drop links
            and forwarding on all interfaces will momentarily stop.

            Do you wish to proceed with this command? [y/N]

Ethernet17 configured for 40G.
Ethernet15, Ethernet17 and Ethernet19 are now subsumed.
switch(config-if-Et13)#
<!-- CODE:END -->

CONTEXT USED:

=== gpt4_no_rag ===
1. Enter into the privileged EXEC mode:
```
enable
```
2. Enter into the global configuration mode:
```
configure terminal
```
3. Specify the interfaces you want to combine. For example, to combine Ethernet interfaces 1 to 4:
```
interface Ethernet1-4
```
4. Set the speed to 40G:
```
speed forced 40gfull
```
5. Exit the interface configuration mode:
```
exit
```
6. Save the configuration changes:
```
write memory
```
7. Verify the configuration:
```
show interfaces status
```
This will display the status of all interfaces. The combined interfaces should now show as a single 40G interface.

=== tiny_llama ===
The configuration should include the correct SFP+ mode and the port number. The EOS CLI commands should be formatted and indented for clarity.
