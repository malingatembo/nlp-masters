EOS CLI commands:

1. List available channels:

   ```
   eos show channels
   ```

   Output:

The Arista EOS CLI commands to tune the wavelength/frequency of DWDM transceivers, including setting specific channel numbers and grid-spacing are as follows:

1. Enter the privileged EXEC mode:

```
enable
```

2. Enter the global configuration mode:

```
configure terminal
```

3. Select the interface where the DWDM transceiver is installed:

```
interface <interface-name>
```

Replace `<interface-name>` with the name of the interface where the transceiver is installed.

4. Set the channel number of the DWDM transceiver:

```
tunable channel <channel-number>
```

Replace `<channel-number>` with the desired channel number.

5. Set the grid-spacing of the DWDM transceiver:

```
tunable grid-spacing <grid-spacing>
```

Replace `<grid-spacing>` with the desired grid-spacing.

6. Exit the interface configuration mode:

```
exit
```

7. Save the changes:

```
write memory
```

8. Verify the changes:

```
show interfaces transceiver detail
```

This will display the details of all the transceivers, including the tuned channel number and grid-spacing.

Please note that the exact commands may vary depending on the specific Arista switch model and the EOS version.

=== gpt4_rag ===
```
switch(config)#transceiver channel <channel_number>
switch(config)#transceiver grid-spacing <grid_spacing_value>
switch(config)#show interfaces transceiver channels
switch(config)#show interfaces transceiver hardware
```
