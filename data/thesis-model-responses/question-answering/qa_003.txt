QUESTION: What show commands are available for displaying configuration sessions in Arista EOS?

=== gpt4_no_rag ===
In Arista EOS (Extensible Operating System), there are several show commands available for displaying configuration sessions. These commands are used to view the current configuration sessions and their details. 

1. `show configuration sessions`: This command displays all the current configuration sessions. It shows the session name, state, user, PID, and the time when the session was started.

2. `show configuration sessions detail`: This command provides detailed information about all the configuration sessions. It includes the session name, state, user, PID, start time, and the configuration changes made in each session.

3. `show configuration sessions <session name>`: This command shows the details of a specific configuration session. You need to replace `<session name>` with the name of the configuration session you want to view.

4. `show configuration sessions diffs`: This command displays the differences between the running configuration and the configuration in each session.

5. `show configuration sessions summary`: This command provides a summary of the configuration sessions, including the total number of sessions and the number of sessions in each state.

6. `show configuration sessions commit-list`: This command shows the list of configuration changes that have been committed in each session.

Remember, these commands must be executed in the privileged EXEC mode or the configuration session mode.
