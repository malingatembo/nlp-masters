QUESTION: Compare and contrast the different multi-lane port types (QSFP+, QSFP100, CFP2, and MXP) in terms of their configuration options and supported speeds.

=== gpt4_no_rag ===
QSFP+, QSFP100, CFP2, and MXP are all multi-lane port types used in high-speed networks. They differ in their configuration options and supported speeds.

1. QSFP+ (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus): QSFP+ is a compact, hot-pluggable transceiver used for data communication applications. It supports Ethernet, Fibre Channel, InfiniBand and SONET/SDH standards with different data rate options. QSFP+ transceivers are designed to carry Serial Attached SCSI, 40G Ethernet, QDR (40G) InfiniBand, FDR (56G) InfiniBand and other communications standards. QSFP+ can support 4 independent channels, each capable of transferring data at a rate of up to 10 Gbps, providing a total package of 40 Gbps.

2. QSFP100 (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable 100G): QSFP100 is an evolution of QSFP+ designed for 100G data rate. It also supports 4 independent channels, but each channel can transfer data at a rate of up to 25 Gbps, providing a total package of 100 Gbps. QSFP100 is used in 100 Gigabit Ethernet and EDR (100G) InfiniBand applications.

3. CFP2 (C Form-factor Pluggable 2): CFP2 is a larger, second-generation version of the CFP transceiver. It supports a higher density of ports on a single line card compared to CFP. CFP2 can support 100G Ethernet and can be configured to support up to 10 independent channels, each capable of transferring data at a rate of up to 10 Gbps, providing a total package of 100 Gbps. CFP2 is typically used in the core of the network where port density is less of a concern.

4. MXP (Multi-lane eXtension Port): MXP is a type of transceiver that can support multiple rates and protocols. MXP can be configured to support up to 16 independent channels, each capable of transferring data at different rates, providing a total package of up to 400 Gbps. MXP is typically used in high-density, high-bandwidth applications.

In summary, while all four types are multi-lane and can support high data rates, they differ in the number of channels and the data rate per channel. QSFP+ and QSFP100 are more compact and suitable for applications where space is a concern, while CFP2 and MXP offer more configuration options and are typically used in high-bandwidth applications.

The context provided does not contain information on CFP2 and MXP multi-lane port types. However, it does provide information on QSFP+ and QSFP100 port types.

Both QSFP+ and QSFP100 modules contain four data lanes that can be used individually or combined to form a single, higher-speed interface. 

For QSFP+, the Ethernet port can be configured as a single 40GbE interface or as four 10GbE interfaces. When the four lanes are combined to form a 40GbE interface, display commands will show lane /1 as connected or not connected, and will show lanes /2 through /4 as errdisabled.

For QSFP100, the Ethernet port can be configured as a single 100GbE interface, a single 40GbE interface, or four 10GbE interfaces. The default mode is a single 100GbE interface. The 7060X, 7260X, and 7320X platforms also allow a QSFP100 port to be configured as two 50GbE interfaces or four 25GbE interfaces. When the lanes are combined to form a higher-speed interface, display commands will show the primary lane(s) as connected or not connected, and will show the other lanes as errdisabled. 

In terms of configuration, both QSFP+ and QSFP100 use the speed command to configure the port's primary lane (/1 lane). However, depending on the platform, this command may restart the forwarding agent, which could result in traffic disruption.
