Configuring a port-channel interface on Arista switches involves several steps. Here is a general guide:

1. **Identify the Interfaces**: First, identify the interfaces you want to include in the port-channel. These should be interfaces that are not currently in use.

2. **Create the Port-Channel**: Use the command `interface Port-Channel <number>` to create the port-channel. Replace `<number>` with the desired port-channel number. For example, to create port-channel 1, you would use the command `interface Port-Channel 1`.

3. **Configure the Interfaces**: Next, you need to configure the interfaces that will be part of the port-channel. Use the command `interface <type> <number>` to select an interface. Replace `<type>` with the type of interface (such as Ethernet) and `<number>` with the interface number. For example, to select Ethernet interface 1, you would use the command `interface Ethernet 1`.

4. **Add the Interface to the Port-Channel**: Once you have selected an interface, use the command `channel-group <number> mode active` to add it to the port-channel. Replace `<number>` with the port-channel number. For example, to add the interface to port-channel 1, you would use the command `channel-group 1 mode active`.

5. **Repeat for Additional Interfaces**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each interface you want to add to the port-channel.

6. **Verify the Configuration**: Finally, use the command `show port-channel summary` to verify that the port-channel has been configured correctly. This will display information about the port-channel and its member interfaces.

Remember that all interfaces in a port-channel should have the same configuration. This includes settings such as speed, duplex mode, and VLAN configuration. If the interfaces have different configurations, the port-channel may not work correctly.

Answer:

1. Create a port-channel interface:

1.1. On the switch, go to the port-channel interface you want to configure.

1.2. Click on the "Create Port-channel" button.

1.3. Fill in the necessary information:

- Port-channel name (e.g. "port-channel1"):
- Port-channel mode (e.g. "broadcast"):
- Number of ports (e.g. 1):

1.4. Click "Create" to create the port-channel interface.

2. Configure the port-channel interface:

2.1. On the port-channel interface, click on "Port-channel" and then "Port-channel configuration".

2.2. Configure the port-channel interface:

- Port-channel mode:
- Number of ports:
- Port-channel name (e.g. "port-channel1"):
- IP address:
- Subnet mask:
- Gateway:
- DHCP server IP address:
- DHCP server MAC address:
- DHCP server IPv6 address:

2.3. Save the configuration.

3. Test the port-channel interface:

3.1. Check if the port-channel interface is up and running.

3.2. Test the port-channel interface by pinging the switch's internal IP address (e.g. "10.1.1.1").

4. Delete the port-channel interface:

4.1. On the switch, go to the port-channel interface you want to delete.

4.2. Click on the "Delete Port-channel" button.

4.3. Confirm the deletion.

4.4. Restart the switch to ensure that the deletion is complete.
