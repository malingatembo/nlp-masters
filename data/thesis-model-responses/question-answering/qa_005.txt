QUESTION: What is the purpose of the 'show hardware port-group' command and what information does it display?

=== gpt4_no_rag ===
The 'show hardware port-group' command is used in networking and telecommunications, specifically in the context of managing and troubleshooting network devices like switches and routers. This command is typically used in the command-line interface (CLI) of these devices.

The primary purpose of this command is to display detailed information about the port groups on a network device. A port group is a set of ports on a switch or router that are grouped together and treated as a single entity for configuration purposes. 

When you run the 'show hardware port-group' command, it provides information such as:

1. The number of port groups on the device.
2. The specific ports that are included in each port group.
3. The status of each port group, such as whether it's active or inactive.
4. The configuration settings for each port group, such as speed, duplex mode, and VLAN settings.
5. Any errors or issues related to each port group.

This information can be very useful for network administrators when they are configuring the device, diagnosing problems, or optimizing network performance.
