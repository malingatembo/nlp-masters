QUESTION: How do you create and configure subinterfaces on Arista switches, and what are their limitations?

Answer:

1. Creating subinterfaces:

To create a subinterface on an Arista switch, you must first assign a name to the subinterface. You can then assign a VLAN to the subinterface, and assign a physical interface to the subinterface.

2. Limitations:

Subinterfaces have some limitations:

- The number of subinterfaces that can be created on a switch is limited by the physical interface count.
- Subinterfaces cannot be created for virtual interfaces.
- Subinterfaces cannot be created on interfaces that are not physical.

3. Configuring subinterfaces:

To configure a subinterface on an Arista switch, you must first ensure that the subinterface is created.

To configure a subinterface, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Arista switch and go to the VLAN configuration screen.
2. Select the subinterface that you want to configure.
3. Click on the "Subinterfaces" tab.
4. Click on the "Add Subinterface" button.
5. Enter the name for the subinterface.
6. Click on the "Add" button.
7. Click on the "Add VLAN" button.
8. Enter the VLAN ID for the subinterface.
9. Click on the "Add" button.
10. Click on the "Add" button.
11. Click on the "Add" button.
12. Click on the "Add" button.
13. Click on the "Add" button.
14. Click on the "Add" button.
15. Click on the "Add" button.
16. Click on the "Add" button.
17. Click on the "Add" button.
18. Click on the "Add" button.
19. Click on the "Add" button.
20. Click on the "Add" button.
21. Click on the "Add" button.
22. Click on the "Add" button.
23. Click on the "Add" button.
24. Click on the "Add" button.

Creating and configuring subinterfaces on Arista switches involves several steps. 

1. First, you need to enter the privileged EXEC mode using the 'enable' command.
2. Then, you need to enter the global configuration mode using the 'configure terminal' command.
3. Next, you need to select the interface you want to configure a subinterface for. You can do this using the 'interface' command followed by the interface type and number. For example, 'interface Ethernet 1'.
4. After selecting the interface, you can create a subinterface using the 'interface' command followed by the interface type, number, and subinterface number. For example, 'interface Ethernet 1.1' would create subinterface 1 on Ethernet interface 1.
5. You can then configure the subinterface as needed. For example, you can assign it an IP address using the 'ip address' command followed by the IP address and subnet mask.

There are some limitations to using subinterfaces on Arista switches. 

1. First, the switch must support the creation of subinterfaces. Not all Arista switches support this feature.
2. Second, the number of subinterfaces you can create may be limited. The exact limit depends on the specific switch model.
3. Third, subinterfaces share the same physical and MAC layer characteristics as their parent interface. This means that if the parent interface goes down, all of its subinterfaces will also go down.
4. Lastly, subinterfaces cannot have a different speed or duplex setting than their parent interface. They inherit these settings from the parent interface.

The context does not provide specific steps on how to create and configure subinterfaces on Arista switches. However, it does mention that once a subinterface is created, it can be configured with features such as unicast and multicast routing, BGP, OSPF, ISIS, PIM, VRF, VRRP, SNMP, QoS, and MTU settings. On Arad platforms (DCS-7500E and DCS-7280E), additional features such as subinterface counters on ingress, VXLAN, MPLS, GRE, PBR, and QoS can be configured. The context does not mention any limitations of subinterfaces on Arista switches.
