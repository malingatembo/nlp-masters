The context provided does not include detailed information on the full process of creating, modifying, and committing a configuration session on Arista EOS, including verification steps. It only provides some code examples related to showing session configuration differences and showing configuration sessions details. For a comprehensive explanation, additional resources or information would be required.

Creating, modifying, and committing a configuration session on Arista EOS involves several steps:

1. **Creating a Configuration Session:** The first step is to create a configuration session. This is done by using the command `configure session <session-name>`. This command will start a new configuration session with the specified session name.

2. **Modifying the Configuration Session:** Once the configuration session is created, you can modify it using various commands. For example, you can use the `interface Ethernet1` command to select an interface and then use the `description` command to modify its description. You can also use commands like `switchport mode trunk` or `switchport access vlan 10` to modify the switchport mode or VLAN. All these changes are made within the configuration session and do not affect the running configuration until they are committed.

3. **Verifying the Configuration Session:** Before committing the changes, you can verify them using the `show session-config diffs` command. This command will display the differences between the running configuration and the configuration session. This allows you to review the changes before committing them.

4. **Committing the Configuration Session:** Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can commit them using the `commit` command. This will apply the changes to the running configuration. If there are any conflicts between the configuration session and the running configuration, the commit will fail and you will need to resolve the conflicts before retrying the commit.

5. **Verifying the Commit:** After committing the changes, you can verify them using the `show running-config` command. This command will display the current running configuration, allowing you to confirm that the changes have been applied.

6. **Ending the Configuration Session:** Finally, you can end the configuration session using the `end` command. This will return you to the privileged EXEC mode.

Remember, it's important to always verify your changes both before and after committing them to ensure that they have been applied correctly and have not caused any unexpected issues.
