QUESTION: How do you assign a MAC address to an interface on an Arista switch and verify the configuration?

=== gpt4_no_rag ===
Assigning a MAC address to an interface on an Arista switch is not a typical operation because MAC addresses are usually burned into the hardware and not typically changed. However, you can configure a static MAC address for a VLAN interface. Here's how you can do it:

1. Enter the configuration mode using the command `configure terminal`.

2. Select the VLAN interface you want to configure. For example, for VLAN 10, you would use the command `interface vlan 10`.

3. Assign the MAC address to the VLAN interface using the command `mac-address <mac-address>`. Replace `<mac-address>` with the MAC address you want to assign. For example, `mac-address 0000.1111.2222`.

4. Exit the configuration mode using the command `exit`.

After assigning the MAC address, you can verify the configuration using the following steps:

1. Use the command `show interface vlan <vlan-id>` to display the configuration of the VLAN interface. Replace `<vlan-id>` with the ID of the VLAN interface you configured. For example, `show interface vlan 10`.

2. In the output, look for the line that starts with `Hardware is`. This line should display the MAC address you assigned to the VLAN interface.

Remember that changing MAC addresses can have significant impacts on your network, including potential security issues and disruption of services. Always ensure you understand the implications before making such changes.
