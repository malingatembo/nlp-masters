QUESTION: Summarize how to configure port groups on DCS-7050Q-16 and DCS-7050QX-32S Arista switches and how they affect interface availability.

=== gpt4_rag ===
Port groups on Arista's DCS-7050Q-16 and DCS-7050QX-32S switches are sets of interfaces that can be configured as either four SFP+ interfaces or a single QSFP+ interface. When configured in SFP+ mode, the port group enables 4 standalone 10GbE interfaces using SFP+ optics. In QSFP+ mode, the port group enables a single QSFP+ interface which can operate as a single 40GbE port, or as four 10GbE ports with the appropriate breakout cabling.

To select the interface mode for a specified port group, the `hardware port-group` command is used. However, it's important to note that this command restarts the forwarding agent, disrupting traffic on all switch ports.

For example, to configure the DCS-7050-Q16 switch to enable four SFP+ interfaces and one extra QSFP+ interface, the following commands can be used:

```
switch(config)#hardware port-group 1 select Et17-20
switch(config)#hardware port-group 2 select Et16/1-4
```

The `show hardware port-group` command can be used to display the status of ports in the port groups.

Port groups on Arista switches like DCS-7050Q-16 and DCS-7050QX-32S can be configured to enhance network performance and redundancy. Port groups are a set of physical ports that are grouped together and treated as a single logical entity. They can be used for link aggregation, increasing the overall network capacity and providing redundancy in case of a port failure.

To configure port groups, the user needs to access the switch's command-line interface (CLI) and use the 'interface Port-Channel' command followed by the port group number. This creates a new port group. Then, the 'channel-group' command is used on each physical interface that should be part of the port group, specifying the same port group number.

Once configured, the port group will act as a single logical interface. This means that if one physical interface in the group fails, the traffic will automatically be redirected to the other interfaces in the group, ensuring continued availability. 

The port group's configuration, including its member interfaces and their status, can be viewed using the 'show Port-Channel summary' command. This can help in monitoring and troubleshooting the network's performance and availability.

It's important to note that all interfaces in a port group should have the same configuration settings, such as speed, duplex mode, and VLAN membership, to ensure proper operation. If there's a mismatch in configuration, it could lead to unexpected behavior or even cause the port group to become inactive.

DCS-7050Q-16:

1. Port Group:

- Create a port group on the switch using the following command:

    ```
    show switchport port-group 1
    ```

- Add ports to the port group:

    ```
    show switchport port-group 1
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.1/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.2/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.3/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.4/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.5/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.6/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.7/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.8/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.9/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.10/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.11/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.12/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.13/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.14/24
    switchport port-group 1 add 192.168.0.
