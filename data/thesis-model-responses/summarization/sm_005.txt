Arista switches support various multi-lane port types, including QSFP+, QSFP100, CFP2, and MXP, each with unique configurations.

QSFP+ is a Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus port type that supports 40 Gigabit Ethernet. It is a compact, hot-pluggable transceiver used for data communication applications. It interfaces networking hardware to a fiber optic or copper networking cable. QSFP+ transceivers are designed to carry Serial Attached SCSI, 40G Ethernet, QDR (40G) and FDR (56G) Infiniband, and other communications standards.

QSFP100 is a variant of QSFP+ that supports 100 Gigabit Ethernet. It is a standard for transceiver communications, primarily used in data centers due to its high data rate. QSFP100 can be broken out into four separate 25 Gigabit lanes, providing flexibility in distributing the total bandwidth.

CFP2 is the second generation of the C form-factor pluggable (CFP) multi-source agreement. It is a standard for transceivers for the transmission of high-speed digital signals. CFP2 supports 100 Gigabit Ethernet and can also be used for other protocols, including OTN (optical transport network). It is approximately half the size of the original CFP, allowing for higher port density.

MXP, or Multi-lane eXtension Port, is a proprietary Arista technology. It is a flexible port type that can operate as 1x100G, 2x40G, 4x10G, or 4x25G. This flexibility allows for a variety of configurations to meet different networking requirements. The MXP port type uses QSFP100 transceivers, which can be broken out into multiple lanes using breakout cables.

In terms of configuration, Arista switches allow for the configuration of these port types through their EOS (Extensible Operating System). The specific configuration steps can vary depending on the specific model of the switch and the desired configuration. However, the process generally involves defining the port type, setting the speed, and enabling the port.

Arista switches support multi-lane or flexible-lane Ethernet ports, which are made up of multiple parallel lanes, each served by its own laser. These multi-lane ports can be configured to operate as a single high-speed interface (a 40GbE or 100GbE interface) or to operate each lower-speed interface independently (four 10GbE or 25GbE interfaces). 

The multi-lane port types include QSFP+, QSFP100, CFP2, and MXP. Each of these port types can be configured using the speed command on the primary lane(s) of the port. 

QSFP+ Ethernet Port Configuration: QSFP+ ports can be configured as four SFP+ interfaces or a single QSFP+ interface. When configured in SFP+ mode, the port group enables 4 standalone 10GbE interfaces using SFP+ optics. When configured in QSFP+ mode, the port group enables a single QSFP+ interface, which can operate as a single 40GbE port, or as four 10GbE ports with the appropriate breakout cabling.

QSFP100 Ethernet Port Configuration: QSFP100 ports can be configured to operate as a single 100GbE interface or as multiple lower-speed interfaces. 

CFP2 Ethernet Port Configuration: CFP2 ports can be configured to operate as a single 100GbE interface or as multiple lower-speed interfaces. When the CFP2 module is configured as a single 100GbE port, the primary lane is displayed as active in the CLI while the other lanes are hidden.

MXP Ethernet Port Configuration: MXP ports can be configured to operate as a single high-speed interface or as multiple lower-speed interfaces. 

The configuration of a multi-lane port is hitless on the 7050X, 7060X, 7250X, 7260X, 7280SE, 7300X, 7320X, and 7500E series platforms. On all other platforms, this command restarts the forwarding agent, which can result in traffic disruption.
