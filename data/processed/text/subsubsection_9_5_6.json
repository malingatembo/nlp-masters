This allows a QSFP+ Ethernet port to be configured as a single 40GbE \ninterface or as four 10GbE interfaces.\n\nWhen the four lanes are combined to form a 40GbE interface, display commands will show lane /1 as \nconnected or not connected, and will show lanes /2 through /4 as errdisabled.\n\nThe following sections describe the configuration of QSFP+ ports.",
