  "content": "Flow control is a data transmission option that temporarily stops a device from sending data because of \na peer data overflow condition. If a device sends data faster than the receiver can accept it, the receiver's \nbuffer can overflow. The receiving device then sends a PAUSE frame, instructing the sending device to \nhalt transmission for a specified period.\n\nFlowcontrol commands configure administrative settings for flow control packets.\n\n\nThe flowcontrol receive command configures the port's ability to receive flow control pause frames.\n\n— off: port does not process pause frames that it receives.\n— on: port processes pause frames that it receives.\n— desired: port autonegotiates; processes pause frames if peer is set to send or desired.\n\n\nThe flowcontrol send command configures the port's ability to transmit flow control pause frames.\n\n— off: port does not send pause frames.\n— on: port sends pause frames.\n— desired: port autonegotiates; sends pause frames if peer is set to receive or desired.\n\nDesired is not an available parameter option. Ethernet data ports cannot be set to desired. Management \nports are set to desired by default and with the no flowcontrol receive command.\n\nThe port linking process includes flow control negotiation. Ports must have compatible flow control \nsettings to create a link. [[TABLE:table_9_7]] lists the compatible flow control settings.\n[[TABLE:table_9_7]] \n\n\n\nExample\n\nThese commands set the flow control receive and send to on on Ethernet interface 5.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_13_2_0]]",
