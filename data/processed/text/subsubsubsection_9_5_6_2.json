On all other platforms, this command restarts the forwarding agent, which will result\nin traffic disruption.\n\nStep 1 Enter interface Ethernet configuration mode for lane /1 of the QSFP+ Ethernet interface.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_6_2_0]]\n\n\nStep 2 Enter the speed forced 10000full command. Depending on the platform, this command may \n\nrestart the forwarding agent, disrupting traffic on all ports for 60 seconds or more.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_6_2_1]]\n\n\nStep 3 Use the show interfaces status command to confirm the change in configuration.\n\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_6_2_2]]",
