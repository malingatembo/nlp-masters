  "content": "--PARENT: subsubsection_9_5_9\n\nEach lane of an MXP port functions as a 10GbE interface when it is not included in a higher-speed \ninterface configuration (either actively or as an errdisabled port).\n\nTo explicitly configure the port as twelve 10GbE interfaces, use the speed command (speed forced \n10000full) on all twelve lanes of the port.\n\nWhen each lane is configured as an independent 10GbE interface, CLI display commands show each \nlane as connected or not connected.\n\nImportant The  speed  command  is  hitless  on  the  7050X,  7060X,  7250X,  7260X,  7280SE,  7300X,  7320X  and  7500E\nseries platforms. On all other platforms, this command restarts the forwarding agent, which will result\nin traffic disruption.\n\nStep 1 Enter interface Ethernet configuration mode for all twelve lanes of the MXP Ethernet interface.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_9_3_0]]\n\n\nStep 2 Enter the speed forced 10000full command. Depending on the platform, this command may \n\nrestart the forwarding agent, disrupting traffic on all ports for 60 seconds or more.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_9_3_1]]\n\n\nStep 3 Use the show interfaces status command to confirm the change in configuration.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsubsection_9_5_9_3_2]]",
