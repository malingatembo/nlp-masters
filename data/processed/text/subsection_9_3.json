  "content": "--ID: subsection_9_3\n\nThe Ethernet physical layer (PHY) includes hardware components connecting a switch\u2019s MAC layer to \nthe transceiver, cable, and ultimately a peer link partner. Data exist in digital form at the MAC layer. On \nthe line side of the PHY, data exist as analog signals: light blips on optical fiber or voltage pulses on \ncopper cable. Signals may be distorted while in transit and recovery may require signal processing.\n\nEthernet physical layer components include a PHY and a transceiver.",
