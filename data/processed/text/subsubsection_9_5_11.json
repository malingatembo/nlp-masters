Only interfaces that pass through a common PHY component can be combined. One \ninterface within a combinable set is designated as the primary port.\n\n\n\n\nTo view the set of available agile ports and the subsumable interfaces that comprise them, enter \nshow platform fm6000 agileport map.\n\nTo configure the primary port as a higher speed port, enter speed forced 40gfull or speed auto \n40gfull.\n\nTo revert the primary port and its subsumed ports to 10G interfaces, enter no speed.\n\nExample\n\nThese commands displays the agile port map for the switch, then configures ethernet interface 13 \nas a 40G port.\n\n[[CODE:code_subsubsection_9_5_11_0]]\n\n<!-- CODE:START -->\nswitch#show platform fm6000 agileport map\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nAgile Ports       |        Interfaces subsumed in 40G link\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nEthernet1         |  Ethernet3      Ethernet5      Ethernet7\nEthernet2         |  Ethernet4      Ethernet6      Ethernet8\nEthernet13        |  Ethernet15     Ethernet17     Ethernet19\nEthernet14        |  Ethernet16     Ethernet18     Ethernet20\nswitch#config\nswitch(config)#interface ethernet 13\nswitch(config-if-Et13)#speed forced 40gfull\n\n  WARNING!
